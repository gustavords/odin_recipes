          <li>500g of Rye Flour</li>
          <li>

            needed)
          </li>
          <li>~10-13g of salt</li>
          <li>
            360g of Sourdough Starter (preferably sourdough fed rye/wholewheat
            flour)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Patience and perseverance.</em>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix your dry ingredients together with a whisk, until nicely
            blended.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix the blended dry ingredients with your Sourdough, until a crumbly
            consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the mixture sit fo ~20-30 mins to proof, as to form some gluten
            structure to mix better later on
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the water and kneed until you get very heavy and thick paste
            (depending on your flour, add less of the water), Rye dough does not
            feel like regular dough due to its low gluten content
          </li>
          <li>
            Shape into a ball, place it in a bowl , lightly oil it with olive
            oil, cover it with cling wrap, and let it rest for 2.5 hours at room
            temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take out dough into a floured surface, and knock back the air,
            expect it to crack as you reshape it into ball.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the shaped dough into a floured bread-banneton or tupperware.
            Let it sit for ~2 hours
          </li>
          <li><strong>Before next steps</strong>, preheat oven to 480-490C</li>
          <li>
            Take loaf out of fridge place into a dutch oven, no need to cut into
            dough, the rye dough will naturally form cracks
          </li>
          <li>
            Place bread into for 40-50mins, make sure to place a tin of water to
            humidify the oven for abetter oven-spring
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the lid of the dutch-oven for 2-3 mins for browning and
            blistering
          </li>
          <li>
            Take out loaf and let it rest ~10 hours to a day before cutting.
            This is an <strong>important</strong> step, as Rye tends to be bit
            gummier.
